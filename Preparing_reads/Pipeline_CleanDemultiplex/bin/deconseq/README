DeconSeq
========

DECONtamination of SEQuence data using a modified version of BWA-SW (http://deconseq.sourceforge.net).

For more information about BWA-SW go to http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/


SETUP
-----

1. Create the databases used for contaminat screening

   Use command:
      bwaXXX index -p database_name -a bwtsw fasta_file_with_reference >out.txt 2>&1 &

      ("XXX" should be replaced by "MAC" or "64" based on your system architecture)

      For alternative system architectures, download BWA version 0.5.9 source code from http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/ (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/bwa-0.5.9.tar.bz2/download); extract the file with "tar -xjf bwa-0.5.9.tar.bz2"; replace files in the extracted BWA directory with the files in bwasw_modified_source (distributed with riboPicker); run "make" in the BWA directory.

   Notes:   (i) It is advised to remove very short or long sequences from files retrieved from public resources. Most likely, those sequences are a result of misannotations and should not be included in the database.
           (ii) Removing ducplicates may reduce the database size and speed up analysis. Tools such as PRINSEQ (http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/) can assist with this task.
          (iii) There seem to be some issues with Mac OSX 10.6.8 that will require you to compile the program (the bwaMAC version might crash).

2. Change values in DeconSeqConfig.pm (if applicable)

   DB_DIR
   TMP_DIR
   OUTPUT_DIR
   PROG_NAME
   PROG_DIR
   DBS
   DBS_DEFAULT

   Notes: (i) If the bwaXXX program is located in the same directory as the ribopicker.pl file, please specify ./ as program directory (use constant PROG_DIR => './';).


USAGE
-----

Run as:
   perl deconseq.pl [options] -f <file> -dbs <list> -dbs_retain <list> ...

or rename file and set chmod +x to run as:
   ./deconseq [options] -f <file> -dbs <list> -dbs_retain <list> ...

Try 'deconseq -h' for more information on the options.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

The PERL script requires these other modules:

   DeconSeqConfig  (included)
   Data::Dumper
   Getopt::Long
   Pod::Usage
   File::Path      >= 2.07
   Cwd
