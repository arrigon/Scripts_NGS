# Scripts NGS 

Welcome to Scripts NGS! This is a collection of all purpose perl wrappers that were written during my postdoctoral stay in the Barker / Salamin and Alvarez groups. 

Several applications are available:
- Reads handling and cleaning
- Assembly (de-novo and ref-based), mostly used for organelles
- Alignment
- Amplicon sequencing (metabarcoding)
- RADs (Stacks)

Most of those scripts embark multi-threading along with a queuing system. They were run on our group servers, by many users. Contact me if needing any modifications or help to get them at work.
